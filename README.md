# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
A machine learning model built using the Random Forest Classifier to detect fraudulent transactions.

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. It analyzes transaction patterns to identify suspicious activities and minimize false alerts. A Random Forest Classifier was used to build the model, and RandomOverSampler helped handle the imbalanced dataset effectively.

The model achieved a precision score of **0.9999**, ensuring highly accurate fraud detection.
